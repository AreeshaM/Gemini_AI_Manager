##  Core Innovation
Traditional project management requires manual task breakdown. **AI Architect** automates this process using **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**, providing:
* **Instant Backlog Generation:** From a single description, it crafts a 5-step technical roadmap.
* **Deep Implementation Insights:** Each task comes with an AI-generated implementation guide and code architecture.
* **Collaboration Suite:** Real-time feedback loops and progress monitoring for lean teams.

## Technical Excellence
* **Backend:** Robust Django Framework with optimized ORM.
* **Intelligence:** Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration via Google GenAI SDK.
* **UX/UI:** Premium **Glassmorphism Design** for an immersive, distraction-free environment.
* **Security:** Enterprise-standard environment variable management for API safety.

## Global Vision (SDG 9)
This tool is built to democratize technical consultancy. It aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal #9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure** by providing small startups and independent developers with high-level technical architectural guidance that was previously only accessible to large enterprises.
